Creating a command is easy. You need to extend the `CommandBase` class.


## Command Class


```java
public class ExampleCommand extends CommandBase {

    public ExampleCommand() {
        super("example", "A example command", false);
    }

    @Override
    protected void executeSync(@Nonnull CommandContext context) {
        context.sendMessage(Message.raw("Hello from ExampleCommand!"));
    }
}
```

## Registering the Command

To register your command, you need to add it to the command manager in your plugin's main class:

```java
public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        this.getCommandRegistry().registerCommand(new ExampleCommand());
    }
}
```
